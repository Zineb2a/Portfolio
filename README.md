# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my work and skills in web development. It's built with React and demonstrates my ability to create responsive, interactive web applications.

## Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.

- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
- The page will reload when you make changes.
- You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
- The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information on deployment, see the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.
